## Overview

A professional, enterprise-grade **Retirement Planning Calculator** built for the HDFC Mutual Fund Hackathon. The tool helps investors understand how much retirement corpus they need and what monthly SIP is required to achieve it — using industry-standard financial formulas, transparent assumptions, and a guided user experience.

Designed to align with HDFC brand guidelines, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, and SEBI/AMFI compliance requirements.

## Features

### Core Calculator
- **5-step guided input wizard** — current age, retirement age, monthly expenses, existing savings, life expectancy
- **Blended inflation model** — weighted average of general CPI inflation and healthcare inflation (user-configurable split)
- **Growing annuity corpus formula** — mathematically correct post-retirement corpus using present value of annuity
- **Step-up SIP calculation** — annual SIP increment compounded year-by-year (not a flat estimate)
- **Existing savings credit** — FV of current corpus reduces the net SIP required
- **Emergency buffer** — configurable percentage added to the base corpus
- **Live real-time recalculation** — all outputs update instantly as inputs change

### Results & Insights
- **Dual-phase projection chart** — visualises accumulation phase and retirement drawdown on a single chart
- **Year-by-year breakdown table** — every year from today to life expectancy with SIP, withdrawal, and corpus balance
- **Key metrics panel** — accumulation period, distribution period, savings future value, funding gap
- **Tax impact estimation** — illustrative tax considerations on SIP and withdrawals
- **National benchmarks** — contextualises the user's corpus vs national averages

### Advanced Features
- **Scenario comparison** — create and compare "what-if" scenarios side-by-side
- **Save & load plans** — authenticated users can persist multiple retirement plans to a MySQL database
- **PDF export** — download a complete projection report as a PDF
- **Full audit trail** — every calculation, save, load, and login is logged for compliance review

### Authentication & Security
- Email + password authentication via NextAuth (JWT sessions)
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- User-owned data — all plans and scenarios scoped to the authenticated user
- Input validation at all API boundaries

## Financial Formulas

### 1. Blended Inflation
```
blendedInflation = (healthcarePct × healthcareInflation) + ((1 − healthcarePct) × generalInflation)
```

### 2. Inflation-Adjusted Retirement Expense
```
retirementMonthlyExpense = currentMonthlyExpense × (1 + blendedInflation)^yearsToRetirement
```

### 3. Retirement Corpus (Growing Annuity / Present Value of Annuity)
```
If postReturnRate ≈ inflationRate:
  corpus = annualExpense × retirementDuration / (1 + postReturnRate)

Otherwise:
  corpus = annualExpense × [1 − ((1 + g) / (1 + r))^t] / (r − g)

  where:
    g = blendedInflation (post-retirement)
    r = postRetirementReturn
    t = retirementDuration (years)
```

### 4. Existing Savings Future Value
```
existingSavingsFV = existingSavings × (1 + preRetirementReturn)^yearsToRetirement
```

### 5. Net Corpus Required
```
remainingCorpus = max(0, corpusRequired − existingSavingsFV)
corpusWithBuffer = remainingCorpus × (1 + emergencyBufferPct)
```

### 6. Required Monthly SIP (with Annual Step-Up)
Computed iteratively: each year's SIP is stepped up by `annualStepUp`, compounded monthly at the pre-retirement return rate, summing forward to retirement.

```
For year y (0 to yearsToRetirement − 1):
  sipThisYear = startingSIP × (1 + annualStepUp)^y
  FV contribution = sipThisYear × ((1 + monthlyRate)^12(yearsToRetirement−y) − 1) / monthlyRate × (1 + monthlyRate)

Total FV = Σ FV contributions = corpusWithBuffer
Solve for startingSIP
```
